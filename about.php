					<p>Tatiana McCarron is the worldâ€™s premier online jewelry and precious stone outlet. We offer finely crafted jewelry including engagement rings, necklaces, earrings, watches, bracelets and more. In 1882 London, an ambitious young woman by the name of Evelyn Ashton started a silversmithing stall after having an apprenticeship with a local jeweler. She saw massive success due to her adaptation of the most advanced crafting techniques and technology known at the time. By the turn of the century, Ms. Ashton had opened up a total of seven storefronts around the market districts of England. Over the years, her business continued to grow at an exponential rate and continues to do so today.</p>
					<p>Fusing old world craftsmanship with modern design and technology, Evelyn Ashton bridges an age-old disconnect between vintage style and modernized production techniques. We continue this tradition of utilizing advanced technologies to continue delivering empirically quality works of wearable art. Each piece in all of our collections start in a factory mass producing base designs that serve as a foundation. These are then brought to our expert silver and goldsmiths to create personalized art out of a standardized canvas of pure metal. The result is a selection of thousands of different artistic outlooks on single base design. Like the people that wear them, every piece has a personality all their own.</p>
